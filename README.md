# Proactive Customer Retention: Churn Prediction for Sustainable Banking Growth

## Overview
In the rapidly evolving landscape of the banking industry, customer retention stands as a linchpin for sustainable growth and financial success. This project addresses the critical challenge of identifying and mitigating customer churn - the phenomenon where customers discontinue their engagement with our services. The objective is to develop a robust churn prediction system that aligns with our business goals and empowers us to proactively retain valuable customers.

## Problem Statement
This repository contains the code and resources for developing a churn prediction model for a banking institution. The goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict which customers are likely to churn, allowing the bank to take proactive measures to retain them. The project aims to address the following key objectives:
- Develop a churn prediction model using historical customer data.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- Interpret the model to identify factors contributing to churn.
- Deploy the model within the bank's infrastructure for real-time predictions.

## Dataset
The churn prediction dataset contains raw data of 28,382 customers and 21 features. The dataset is not included in this repository due to privacy reasons. However, instructions for obtaining the dataset are provided below:

1. Contact the data administrator to request access to the churn prediction dataset.
2. Once access is granted, download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory of this repository.

## Usage
To replicate the churn prediction model and analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/churn-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd churn-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to execute the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
